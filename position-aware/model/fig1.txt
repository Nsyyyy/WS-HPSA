Fig. 1. (a) Intra-bag similarities and frame-level entanglement: Nor-
mal snippet 1 achieves a high anomaly score and thus is mistakenly
identified as an anomaly because of the similarity between abnormal
and normal snippets 2. Abnormal snippet 3 with a low anomaly score
is misclassified as normal due to the entanglement of normal and
abnormal targets, where the scale of normal targets is significantly
larger than abnormal targets. (b) Anomalies looming and receding:
Anomalous targets may either approach or move away from the
camera, resulting in scale variations of these targets.
